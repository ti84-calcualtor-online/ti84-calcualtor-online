        <h2>What is TI 84 Calculator</h2>
        <p>The TI 84 Calculator is one of the most widely used graphing calculators created by Texas Instruments (TI). It is trusted by students, teachers, and professionals because it combines advanced features with an easy design.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Differences from a Basic Calculator</h3>
        <p>A normal calculator can only handle simple tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The TI 84 goes much further by allowing you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw and analyze graphs of functions</li>
            <li>Solve algebra problems such as quadratic and linear equations</li>
            <li>Perform probability and statistics calculations</li>
            <li>Work with trigonometry and calculus</li>
            <li>Store data and run custom programs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why It Stands Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Large Screen</strong> – Shows graphs and multiple lines of work</li>
            <li><strong>Trusted in Education</strong> – Accepted in many exams and courses</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Purpose Tool</strong> – Useful for school, college, and even professional fields like engineering and finance</li>
